# clj-hisoutensoku

When my autohotkey script stroke 1500 lines, my patience was
broken, and I tried to find a way to make things lispy way.
That's like this package was created. It uses Winapi throung
JNA, and creates re-mapping system lispy way.

This script is created to extend controls in
[Touhou 12.3 Hisoutensoku](http://hisouten.koumakan.jp/wiki/Main_Page) game.

## Usage

If you don't want to compile the code yourself, just copy
and run target/clj-hisoutensoku.jar and run. Else, use
[Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/) to
build the project (use "lein run" or "lein uberjar").
Didn't made any interface, so you'll end up closing it from
your process manager. :)

It only works with english touhou window title. You can
change that and recompile the project.
It have pre-defined hotkey rules inside. You can use that as
an example to make your own script.

Set up player keys like that:
up - w;
down - s;
left - a;
right - d;
Melee - z;
Weak Shot - x;
Strong Shot - c;
Flight - v;
Switch card - b;
Use card - n;

Resulting config:
You can use all 8 numpad directions, numpad5 stands for Flight(D).

Holding 1 or 3 or 7 or 9 and Enter or Plus will make some
special moves. For example, 1+enter is 236b
(Hisoutensoku-style key input, stands for press down, press
right, up down, up right, press x, up x).
6+9+end is tkj6a, Home+numbers - specials, 1+6 = 66, 3+4 = 44,
1+6+end = 66 j6a loop, 1+6+enter = 66 j5c loop.
